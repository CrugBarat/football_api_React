# Football API

A very basic Football app built using:

**Programming Language**: JavaScript

**Web App Framework**: React

**Markup/Styling**: HTML5/CSS3

The app fetches data from a REST API and displays it on select.

This exercise was tasked to me by CodeClan, Glasgow where I studied towards a PDA Level 8 in Professional Software Development. The exercise brief can be found below.

# Brief

Practice what we’ve learned in the past few days by making a small React app. This could be similar to the countries app we made that had a dropdown menu, which when selected, displayed some information about that option.

Remember to have a container and component folder. Containers will handle data requests, state changes and callbacks. Components will handle visualisation logic (and only have access to props).

**Football Data**

[Football Data API](https://www.football-data.org/documentation/quickstart)

You need to sign up for a free [API key](http://api.football-data.org/register) which should be emailed to you right away, and then include this in any requests to the API.
